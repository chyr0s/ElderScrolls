# Combat Magic Overhaul

Cast combat magic with every school of Magic. Grants multiple new spells for all skill levels of each school of magic (except Destruction). Each school of magic will have a single type of enemy that they may be used against, and will be entirely ineffective against all other enemies - this is so that the player can not simply boost all schools of magic by hitting the same enemies.

I am toying around with two potential mappings of the types of enemy each school can affect:

|School|Enemy List 1|Enemy List 2|
|------|------------|------------|
|Alteration|Automatons|Daedra|
|Conjuration|Daedra|Undead|
|Enchanting|Mer|Automatons|
|Illusion|Humanoids|Animals|
|Restoration|Undead|Humanoids|

Enchanting may not be a viable option; if it is not possible, the possibilities will be:

|School|Enemy List 1|Enemy List 2|
|------|------------|------------|
|Alteration|Automatons|Beasts & Monsters|
|Conjuration|Humanoids|Daedra & Undead|
|Illusion|Beasts & Monsters|Automatons|
|Restoration|Daedra & Undead|Humanoids|
