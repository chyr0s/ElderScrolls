# Plane of Oblivion

Discover a small plane of oblivion just for you, complete with a quest detailing the history behind it.

Once the quest has been completed, this plane of oblivion will contain portals to various places throughout Skyrim, as well as an Arboretum, a bedroom, a storage area, a display area, a training facility; and Amroz, a Skaafin merchant who takes... _alternative_...payment.
