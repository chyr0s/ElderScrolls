# Combat Magic Overhaul
Cast combat magic with every school of Magic. Grants multiple new spells for all skill levels of each school of magic. I am toying around with two potential mappings of the types of enemy each School can affect:

|School|Enemy List 1|Enemy List 2|
|------|------------|------------|
|Alteration|Automatons|Daedra|
|Conjuration|Daedra|Undead|
|Destruction|Animals|Man|
|Enchanting|Mer|Automatons|
|Illusion|Man|Animals|
|Restoration|Undead|Mer|

Enchanting may not be a viable option, I may need to attempt to script it in Papyrus, which will take longer and may not be possible.

If it is not possible to include spells for Enchanting, the possibilities will be:

|School|Enemy List 1|Enemy List 2|
|------|------------|------------|
|Alteration|Automatons|Daedra|
|Conjuration|Daedra|Undead|
|Destruction|Animals|Automatons|
|Illusion|Humanoids|Animals|
|Restoration|Undead|Humanoids|

# Combat Magic Overhaul 2

A smaller combat magic mod that allows the caster to specialise in alternate forms of combat. May be game breaking.
